# Greeps-Contest-Submission
File Name: greep.java

Language: Java

Description:
This is my greep.java submission for the Greenfoot Greeps competition. The objective is to program the behavior of the greeps to gather as many tomatoes as they can on a set of maps given a time limit. Performance is based on the number of tomatoes the greeps delivered to the ship when the time for the map runs out. On 3 different trials, I successfully got an average of 173 tomatoes on the 10 maps.

Instructions:
To run this program, you need to install greenfoot, and you need to install and import the classes for greeps while running greenfoot. Then you must import my greeps.java file in place of the greeps file it comes with.
